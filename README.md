# primate-deep-retina

## Overview
### In this repository, we provide a data and model release of the Deep Retina light response model applied to recordings of primate retinal ganglion cells acquired from the Chichilnisky Lab at Stanford University. This model was originally developed by the Baccus lab in the salamander retina, in a series of two papers linked here: [Mcintosh et al., 2016 _NeurIPS_](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/hash/a1d33d0dfec820b41b54430b50e96b5c-Abstract.html) and [Maheswaranathan et al., 2023 _Neuron_](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(23)00467-1).
